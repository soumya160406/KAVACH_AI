🛡️ Kavach AI

An AI-Powered Digital Security & Threat Detection Platform

📌 Overview

Kavach AI is an intelligent security platform designed to detect threats, prevent fraud, and enhance digital safety using AI-driven analysis and real-time monitoring. The system acts as a digital shield (Kavach) that continuously analyzes data patterns, flags suspicious activity, and assists users and organizations in making secure decisions.

This project focuses on automation, scalability, and proactive defense, making it suitable for real-world cybersecurity use cases.

🎯 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world:

Cyber threats are increasing rapidly

Manual monitoring is slow and inefficient

Traditional security systems react after damage is done

There is a need for a smart, proactive, and AI-assisted security solution that can:

Identify threats early

Reduce human effort

Improve response time

Kavach AI addresses this gap.

💡 Solution

Kavach AI uses AI logic + backend automation to:

Monitor user or system activity

Analyze behavioral patterns

Detect anomalies and potential threats

Alert users/admins in real time

The platform is designed to be modular, extensible, and future-ready.

⚙️ Tech Stack Frontend

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Responsive and modern UI

JavaScript (ES6+) – Client-side logic and API interaction

Backend

Node.js – Server-side runtime

Express.js – REST API framework

Database

MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing users, logs, and threat data

AI / Logic Layer

Rule-based + pattern analysis logic

Suspicious activity detection using data thresholds and anomaly checks

Designed to be easily extendable to ML models in the future

Tools & Platforms

Git & GitHub

Postman (API testing)

VS Code

🧠 How Kavach AI Works 1️⃣ Data Collection

User/system activity data is captured via APIs

Inputs may include login attempts, request frequency, behavioral patterns, etc.

2️⃣ Analysis Engine

Incoming data is analyzed using predefined rules and AI logic

Patterns are compared against normal behavior

Anomalies and suspicious activities are identified

3️⃣ Threat Detection

If abnormal behavior crosses a defined threshold:

It is flagged as a potential threat

Severity level is assigned

4️⃣ Alert & Response

Alerts are generated for admins/users

Logs are stored for auditing and future analysis

Enables faster response and prevention
